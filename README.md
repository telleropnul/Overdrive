# Overdrive

## What is Overdrive ##
Overdrive is a non-intrusive Blender add-on offering the following performance enhancements:

Automatically show / hide the last bevel modifier on the modifier stack for all objects in the scene based on mouse inactivity.

## How to use ##
When in 3D viewport, press [F3].  Search for “Overdrive” and select to run.
Press [RMB] or [ESC] to exit Overdrive.

## Important information ##
Overdrive is non-intrusive and automatically pauses whenever you:
* Enter [Edit Mode]
* Use [MMB] to rotate 3D viewport.
* Switch to a Viewport Shading mode other than [Solid]

If you want bevel enabled in any of the above, simply wait for 1 second for last bevel to become active and then perform these tasks.
Now your bevel is visible for the entire duration of that task.
